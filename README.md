# Hip Light UI theme

A hip new take on the atom light theme for interface components.

A lot of the color decisions will be based off the current color scheme of my personal site and it is best used with the Solarized Light Syntax Theme.

This theme is a work in progress and will hopefully be finished when I have time.

Cheers!
